# The board bundle contract (mica:docs/boards/contract.md, C1 of plan
# 20260913-0416): every board directory declares what the assembly reads
# out of its bundle, and nothing the bundle no longer carries.
#
#   - board.env declares BOARD_FEATURES (a subset of the vocabulary below) and
#     IMAGE_KINDS (a subset of its vocabulary), as plain KEY=value lines;
#   - the board carries its whole build (boards/README.md): Makefile,
#     kernel/Dockerfile and a git row <board>-kernel in locks/upstream.lock; a FIT
#     board also bsp.env, a git row <board>-uboot,
#     kernel/configure.sh, kernel/build.sh and loader/Dockerfile; its Makefile
#     includes nothing outside the board;
#   - manifests/board.pkgs exists and names at least one package; every
#     manifest is one package per line and names only packages a producer
#     of this repository emits (tools/deb/producers.sh);
#   - manifests/radio-<r>.pkgs names a radio in BOARD_FEATURES,
#     manifests/component-<c>.pkgs a word; any other manifest name is refused;
#   - a board carries no producer: producers/board runs over every board; its kernel, U-Boot,
#     firmware and definition are component artifacts (tools/component.sh), not packages;
#   - containers.env is gone: the product decides features, not the board.
#
# Discovered, not listed: a board is a directory with a board.env.
